Mission to Planet Earth: A Digital History

One day
people care about the earth. The other 364 days they're too busy killing it. 


Do you feel motivated? while saying “Happy Earth Day”, because we don’t!

Visualising the Earth through NASA's lenses, we aim to study the completed projects of NASA focussing on Earth and it's attributes. Using Tableau and Python, we will import essential data sets and by the means of graphs we will plot multiple values against standard values to decipher trends, threats and possible reasons that affect life on Earth. Today such tools are more important than ever, as COVID-19 has limited access to classrooms and museums. Digital tools can also reach people who might never have an opportunity to visit NASA facilities.

Also, we will be representing stories about NASA’s Earth science enterprise using interactive digital tools which will be a reflection of our technical background and the ability to think like historians. Using text and images, we will potray bigger as well as smaller picture on how technology has brought us closer to the study of Earth and other astronomical bodies. With predictions we can also highlight what can be the need of future or how we can use Earth Science to eliminate threats or expand on hidden or lesser known artifacts.

Lastly, for discussion ASteroids would dive into the functioning of NASA, their documentation and their modus-operandi. Pitching the Project in such a way that even a beginner would love Earth Science, will remain our focus first step onwards.
